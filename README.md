# Project5-DS1043

Personal library with generally useful functions. Created for submission as Project 5 in DS-1043 FA24.

An appropriate Markdown file containing the supplementary documentation for the functions is provided as `personal_library.md`.

The Python functions can be found in the `.py` file named `SWpj5.py`.

The library test functions can be found in the `.py` file named `test_pj5.py`. Note that the test functions provided may not all work, notably test_count() and test_search(). 
This is due to the file management involved in both of the functions, and the implemented methods may not work on all machines. 
By default, they are omitted under comments. Instead, it is recommended to test them manually with your own text files if necessary.
